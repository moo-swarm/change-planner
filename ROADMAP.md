# Change Planner — Roadmap

Derived from GOAL.md. Rebuilt when GOAL changes or an epic ships.

## Current epic
None — idle. See `## Next epics` below.

## Next epics
1. **E1: Home screen discovery** — serves #5. Surface what needs attention and find things across a growing initiative list. [#53](https://github.com/agile-toolkit/change-planner/issues/53) (cross-initiative "This Week" due/overdue digest), [#57](https://github.com/agile-toolkit/change-planner/issues/57) (text search across initiatives by title/goal/stakeholder).
2. **E2: Export & sharing enhancements** — serves #4. Extend "get data out of the browser" beyond PNG/Markdown/JSON/URL-share. [#54](https://github.com/agile-toolkit/change-planner/issues/54) (print-optimized `@media print` view), [#58](https://github.com/agile-toolkit/change-planner/issues/58) (export action due dates as an `.ics` calendar file).
3. **E3: RACI responsibility tagging** — serves #2. Adds a `raci` field to actions, linking to stakeholder profiles, so action ownership tracking gets more precise. [#55](https://github.com/agile-toolkit/change-planner/issues/55).
4. **E4: Automated test coverage** — foundational; vitest is configured and the baseline suite runs green (`npm test`, 14 tests passing as of 2026-08-24). Remaining scope is coverage itself: core utilities (`sharing.ts` encode/decode, `sortInitiatives`, `isOverdue`, `boardItemToAction`) protect criteria #2–#4 from regressions as new epics land. [#56](https://github.com/agile-toolkit/change-planner/issues/56).

## Polish backlog
- [#59](https://github.com/agile-toolkit/change-planner/issues/59) — hardcoded English placeholder in `FacetCard.tsx` notes textarea; 1-line fix, use existing `facets.notes_placeholder` i18n key.
